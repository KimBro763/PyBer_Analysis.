# PyBer_Analysis.

## Project Overview
### Purpose and Background
The purpose of this project is to help PyBer improve access to their ride-sharing services app. A summary of ride-sharing data by city type was created. Additionally, Pandas and Matplotlib was used to create a multi-line graph visualizing total fares grouped by city type.


## PyBer Analysis Results:


#### *1. Urban Ride-Sharing Data* 
From January 1, 2019 to April 29, 2019, there were a total of 1,625 rides shared in urban city types with the help of 2,405 total drivers. The total fares received in urban areas totaled $39,854.38. In addition, $24.53 was the average fare per ride while $16.57 was the average fare per driver. For more information, please see Table 1 below. 

While January 1, 2019 is the week with the lowest total fares for Urban city types, it is the highest total fare of all city types. It also continues trending upward through April 29, 2019. PyBer experiences peak total fares in the last week of February and again in the second week of March. However, each week in March tends to exhibit a high peak or a low dip in the data, but the month of April is fairly stable and finishes approximately $500 higher than its first recorded data point on January 1st. For more information, please see Figure 1 below. 

#### *2. Suburban Ride-Sharing Data* 
In Suburban city types, 624 rides were shared. With a total of 490 drivers, the total fares collected was $19,356.33. Finally, the average fare per ride was $30.97, and the average fare per driver was $39.50. A summary of this information can be found in Table 1 below. 

Starting at approximatley $750, suburban total fares for the week of January 1, 2019, are the second highest-fares of each city type. As with urban city types, suburban types experience a peak at the end of February and again during the last week of April. The month of March shows a relatively consistent record of total fares, while the month of April visualizes a dip in its second week but finishes with a year-to-date record high edging towards $1500. 

For more information, please see Table 1 or Figure 1 below. 


#### *3. Rural Ride-Sharing Data*
Rural city-types only had a total of 125 rides shared, and with 78 total drivers, they also had the least amount of drivers. In addition, they had the least amount of total fares at $4,327.93. However, the average fare per ride is the highest of all city types at $34.62. Finally, the average fare per driver is the highest for rural city types, as well, with each driver making an average of $55.49 per ride. Please refer to Table 1 for more information. 

The first week of January shows the total fares for rural city types at approximately $200. The weeks with the lowest total fares are the second week of January, the second week of February, and the third week of February. On trend with the other city types, the third week of February exhibits a peak in its data. However, for rural city types, the first week of April demonstrates its highest total fares at $500. The remainder of April displays a downward trend with the rural city types finishing at approximately $250, which is a little higher than its beginning total fares in January. Figure 1 below contains more information.

## *Summary:*
Based on the analysis, three recommendations have been provided. 

#### *1. Rural City Types:*
While rural city types may have the least amount of total rides, they average a higher fare per ride at approximately $10 more than urban cities and $4.50 more than suburban cities. In addition, rural city drivers' average almost $40 per fare, making it more profitable for drivers. Therefore, it is the first recommendation to build access to the ride-sharing app in rural areas as this growth could potentially be very beneficial to PyBer and its drivers. 

#### *2. February:*
The third week of February exhibits a peak in the data for each city type. Accordingly, focusing efforts to expand access to PyBer more heavily around this time may help to increase these peaks even more. 

#### *3. Suburban City Types:*
The difference in the average fare per ride between suburban city types and urban city types is almost $15.00. Further, there is approximately a $24.00 difference betwen the average fare per driver between suburban and urban city types. This disparity is the basis for the final recommendation, which is to provide more access to suburban city types. With the potential of more rides, total fares and average fares could increase exponentially.
